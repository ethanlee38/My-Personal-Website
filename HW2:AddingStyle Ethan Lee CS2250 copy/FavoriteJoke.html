    <div class="left">Check out that right margin</div>
    <div class="middle">I dont wanna sound like a braggart saying this, but the real, like, reason I wanna stop is because Im too goddamn good at it. Im dope, n*, like Im not even Im not even exaggerating. Its not exciting. Every night before I come out on stage, Ill be backstage like, Im sure this is gonna go well. And it always does.
        Im so good at writing jokes And this is not even an exaggeration. I actually write jokes backwards. I will write a punch line with no particular setup in mind. I just put it on a scrap of paper, and Ill throw that scrap of paper in my fishbowl. I have a fishbowl in my house filled with random punch lines. And every once in a while, Ill shake the bowl and Ill dig in there and pull one out, and see if I can make that shit work. And I picked one for this special. Its not an easy punch line to pull off. Are you ready? [audience] Yeah. Here it goes. The punch line is, So I kicked her in the pussy. I havent finished the joke yet. I just know whatever happens in the beginning of the joke, at the end of the joke, for some reason, Im gonna kick somebody in the pussy, and its going to be hilarious. You know whats weird? Ive always been this talented. I cant remember a time when I wasnt.
        You know, when I was growing up, I was probably about eight years old, and at the time, we were living in Silver Spring. Yeah. Yes. Common misconception about me and DC, a lot of people think Im from the hood. Thats not true. But I never bothered to correct anybody because I wanted the streets to embrace me. As a matter of fact, I kept it up as a ruse. Like sometimes Ill hang out with rappers like Nas and them, and these motherfuckers start talking about the projects. Yo, it was wild in the PJs, yo. And Ill be like, Word, n*, word. But I dont know. I have no idea. My parents did just well enough so that I could grow up poor around white people. To be honest, when Nas and them talk about the projects, n*, I used to get jealous. Because it sounded fun. Everybody in the projects was poor, and thats fair. But if you were poor in Silver Spring, n*, it felt like it was only happening to you. Nas does not know the pain of that first sleepover at a white friends house. When you come back home on Sunday and just look at your parents like Yall need to step your game up. Everything at Timmys house works. Remember the first time you saw that? The cold winter and to be at a white friends house and see them motherfuckers in their living room without their coats on?
        Timmy was one of my first white friends, like, in my life, man. Good dude, too. He moved to Silver Spring from Utah of all places. I guess his family was affiliated with that Mormon church they got down there. Me and him used to hang out. One day, I was at his house, just hanging out, and Timmy says, Dave, why dont you stay for dinner tonight? I said, Oh, man, Id love to, but I cant. If Im not home before dark, my mother will kill me. That was a lie. My mother had several jobs. I hadnt seen her in three or four days. And the only reason I lied to Timmy was because at that point in my life, it was my experience that white dinner wasnt delicious. Id rather go home and fry some bologna or some shit like that. But then old Timmy threw me a curveball I wasnt expecting. He said, Oh, its too bad you cant stay, Dave, cause Mama made Stove Top stuffing. I said, What the fuck? Stove Top? Hold on, n*. Let me make some phone calls real quick. I had seen that commercial so many times, I had dreamt of getting my hands on some of that Stove Top stuffing. Finally I met a motherfucker that actually had a box of Stove Top in the house. I couldnt miss this opportunity, so I pretended to call my mother. Then I came back and I said, Timmy. Timmy, youre not gonna believe this. Great news. Mom said I can stay. He said, Fantastic. He said, Why dont you come with me, and well help set the table, and then we can say the blessing? I had no interest in setting this motherfuckers table or saying these crazyass Mormon prayers. I just wanted the goddamn stuffing. I told Timmy, You know what? Id love to help, but let me go wash my hands first. My plan was simple. Wash my hands slowly, and by the time Im done, the table will be set, the blessing will be said, and all that there will be left to do is eat. Went to the bathroom. I wash my hands very slowly. I must have been in there for about ten minutes. And suddenly one of his mothers came to the door. She was like, Hi. David, right? I said, Yes, maam. She said, Timmy tells me that youre planning on staying for dinner. I said, I hope thats not a problem, maam. She says, No, its no problem. Wed love to have you. Its just that we werent expecting company. And Im afraid theres not enough Stove Top stuffing for everybody. So I kicked her in the pussy.  Ladies and gentlemen I told you Im dope, n*. I told you that I was gonna say it, and you still didnt see it coming. And thats why I make the big bucks.
